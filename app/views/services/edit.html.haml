  Headers:

%ul
  - @service.latest_version.headers.each do |a|
    %li
      = a.name
/ ************* I added some of this for clarification.  This page can be refactored of what information will be truly relevant
%div.container
  When you are adding data, make sure that the file you are uploading does not contain data that already exists if you do not want duplicate data.
  %div
    To see what data already exists,
    =link_to "click here.", "/services/#{@service.slug}/records"

Make sure that your file has the following headers
%ul
  - @service.latest_version.headers.each do |key|
    %li
      = key.name
